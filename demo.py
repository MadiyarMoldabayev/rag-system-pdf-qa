    Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
    
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create 
    intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
    
    Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms that can learn 
    and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.
    
    Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple 
    layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.
    
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction 
    between computers and humans through natural language.
    
    Computer Vision is a field of AI that enables machines to interpret and understand 
    visual information from the world.
    
    Applications of AI include:
    - Autonomous vehicles
    - Medical diagnosis
    - Recommendation systems
    - Fraud detection
    - Language translation
    - Image recognition
